# CS292C Computer-Aided Reasoning for Software

This course is a graduate level introduction to formal program verification techniques, and their application in tools for the design, analysis, and construction of software. In the first half of the course, we will survey the automated side of program verification -- introducing the logical foundations and algorithms behind SAT and SMT **solvers**. However, as we will see, the automated approach is inherently limited by the undecidability problem. Thus, in the second half of the course, we will turn to manual side, which aims to prove the correctness of programs with *manual proofs* machine-checked by an **interactive theorem prover**.

# Grading (No curving)

| Letter | Percentage |
| ------ | ---------- |
| A+     | 95–100%    |
| A      | 90–94%     |
| A-     | 85–89%     |
| B+     | 80–84%     |
| B      | 75–79%     |
| B-     | 70–74%     |
| C+     | 65–69%     |
| C      | 60–64%     |
| F      | <60%       |

- Weekly written assignments: 40%
   - Self-graded on **effort** on a scale of 0-2, but will be checked by the TA:
     - 0: problem not attempted at all
     - 1: problem attempted, but not fully solved, and all work shown
     - 2: problem fully solved
   - *A self-grade of 1 is enough to get full credit for a problem.*

- 3 programming projects: 60%



# Late Policy
You have a total of 10 late days to be used throughout the quarter. You can use them in any way you like.



# Academic Integrity
- Cheating WILL be taken seriously. It is not fair toward honest students to take cheating lightly, nor is it fair to the cheater to let him/her go on thinking that cheating is a reasonable alternative in life.
- The following is not considered cheating:
   - discussing broad ideas about programming assignments in groups, without being at a computer (with code-writing and debugging done individually, later).
- The following is considered cheating:
   - discussing programming assignments with someone who has already completed the problem, or looking at their completed solution.
   - looking at anyone else’s solution
   - Previous versions of the class.
   - leaving your code (for example in an online repository) visible to others, leading others to look at your solution.
   - receiving, providing, or soliciting assistance from unauthorized sources during a test.
- Programming assignments are not intended to be grade-makers, but to prepare you for the tests, which are the grade-makers. Cheating on the programming assignment is not only unethical, but shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of these assignments.
- Penalties: First time: a zero for the assignment; Second time: an “F” in the course.
